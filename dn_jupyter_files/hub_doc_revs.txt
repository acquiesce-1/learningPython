Masses of scope to implement your ideas and help the company growth so you feel like you are adding value.
An incredibly well stocked kitchen!

None that I have seen so far!

"Exceptional Team, Product + Opportunity"
Former Employee - Anonymous Employee

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I worked at Hubdoc full-time

Pros

The most intelligent people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and working with are at Hubdoc. The Jamies are building a great company powered by thoughtful, dedicated people and a product that has unbelievable market fit.
Every day at Hubdoc presents a learning opportunity, a new experiment, a "wow" moment from a colleague's brilliance and soooo many laughs (seriously this team is …

Cons

This isn't a clock-in, clock-out type of environment. You will work hard, but this is standard for a rapidly growing startup.
Expectations are high and you will be pushed to do great things. It's not always easy, but you will always be supported by leadership. You will be a better, more well-rounded professional having worked at Hubdoc.

Advice to Management

Continue to listen to your employees. It's noticed and appreciated when feedback is implemented. The value you place on your team's opinions is one of your biggest strengths.

Doesn't Recommend
Negative Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I worked at Hubdoc full-time (More than a year)

Pros

Relaxed environment, great snacks, product has potential with right skills and leadership to drive the company.

Cons

CEOs are learning on the job and management is learning on the job. CEOs have their favourites and its obvious. Building company with new grads isn't so great for culture and all they talk about is summer camp and university. Location isn't that great. Hours are long and even though it isn't a requirement to stay late you feel bad if you leave on time because no one else has much of a life so they stay at work late.

Advice to Management

Hire some experienced managers.

"Your dream career awaits"
Former Employee - Account Manager in Toronto, ON

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I worked at Hubdoc full-time (More than a year)

Pros

-Unbelievable career opportunity. Hubdoc tripled its subscriber base over 2016 and it is poised to explode in 2017 and beyond. An employee recently moved to Australia to open the Hubdoc office there!
-Learn from the best. The co-CEOs are awesome. They've worked for some of the world's best known brands. They've already ran a company from start-up to acquisition. Hubdoc is round 2.
-Show that you care …

Cons

-The work can get repetitive depending on your role. State your career intentions, put your time in, and you'll get to where you want to go as the company grows
-A lack of performance feedback from management (side effect of the start-up environment). If you do what is expected of you and you do it well, this won't be a problem

Advice to Management

Double down on product stability, design, and features and the sky is the limit. Done an awesome job so far and I'm really looking forward to seeing where it goes.

I have been working at Hubdoc full-time (Less than a year)

Pros

Best co-op job I ever had. I got a chance to own and deliver entire projects, and learn a ton. Would not have had an opportunity to do as much or be responsible for as much anywhere else.
+ Awesome work environment that is open and transparent
+ The team is very skilled and intelligent
+ The full time employees are winners that know how to get stuff done. They make the best mentors
+ Monthly hackdays …

Cons

The team does work long hours since there is always things to do.

Advice to Management

+ More lunch & learns?
+ Hackdays may be more productive if collaboration is encouraged
